Maybe there should be different types of 'add_effect'
because not all relics need events. Some just do things
when they are equipped like a max health upgrade.

relic that decreases the count for all counter relics by 1
- Needs to find all the relics with related effect and modify the count stat
	- DONE, but could potentially be improved beyond a simple search.
- New counter relic must also be affected
	- DONE, on_player_add_relic event
- Removable
- What if this relic is modified? Needs to propagate the changes down.


equipment (A) that adds 2 health to all players
equipment (B) that modifies A, double effect for [condition]

Turn events into objects with predefined properties
Validate events on relics and make sure that event is compatible
Some relics might have predefined connected events
- Counter modifiers need to have a "on_player_add_relic" to update new relics
