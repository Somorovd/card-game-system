For a long time I have been interesting in deck building and trading card games (real and digital) such as Magic: The Gathering, Dominion, Ascension, Slay the Spire, Inscryption, and many more,
as well as Rouge-like games such as Enter the Gungeon, Into the Breach, Risk of Rain, Peglin etc. etc. In the future I would love to design a similar style game. 

I started by doing some research into how one could go about implementing a card game with many cards and many keywords. There were many tutorials on how to set up a card game 
so that you could draw and play cards in turns, but very little about actually getting into the meat of the game itself. 

At the same time I was reading the Design Patterns book by the Gang of Four, which I found thoroughly fascinating, so I decided to try and apply the newly learned patterns to make a little
system for myself to help build a game. For now, in this little playground, I am working in python since prototyping and iteration is quite quick, 
but in the future I would like to implement a similar system with a strongly typed language.
